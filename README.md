##  Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreyasVibhute55/stock-price-prediction-lstm.git
cd stock-price-prediction-lstm

Install dependencies
Make sure you are in a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your stock CSV data
Put your .csv stock file inside the data/ folder. Example: TSLA.csv

Run the app

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
 Sample Output
Training vs Validation loss plot

Predicted vs Actual stock price graph

 Notes
Make sure your CSV file contains a Date and Close column.

You can easily switch to different stock data by changing the CSV file name.

Model architecture and parameters can be fine-tuned in app.py.
